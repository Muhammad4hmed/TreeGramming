<h1>Data Structures Project - 3rd semester project</h1>

<h2>TreeGramming - Where Data Structures meets AI.</h2>

Basically there are three features,
<list>
1. BST for Strings
2. Decision Tree (Using Discrete Concept )
3. Natural Language Processing - Sentiment Analysis
</list>
<br>
<list>
1. Lexographical Comparision is done between strings and are placed at their correct positions and its also visualized.<br>
2. Decision tree using discrete concept, its just a model and can be expanded further, you feed the data and it place it at its correct position and also visualize it.<br>
3. NLP - Sentiment Analysis, with 99% accuracy. python script is used instead of C++. <b>as I have downloaded the datasets to train the model, these datasets might not be in your computer so instead of training you can directly test the model! as the trained model is saved model.pickcle file { MUST } </b>
</list>

<b>Please move the images from imagess folder to your computer's download folder ( that is in your user directory ) { MUST }</b>

Happy Coding.!
